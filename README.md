# 💸 Split Bill App (React)

A React application I designed and built from scratch to help users split expenses with friends and track balances easily. This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive user interfaces, manage shared state, and implement real world business logic using modern React practices.

## 🚀 Features

- Built a dynamic friend management system
- Implemented bill splitting with real time balance calculation
- Created controlled forms with clean user experience
- Automatically calculates who owes whom
- Displays balance status for each friend
- Uses conditional rendering for smooth UI flow
- Clean and minimal interface focused on usability

## 🛠️ Built With

- React (useState hook)
- JavaScript ES6+
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Component based architecture

## 📚 What This Project Demonstrates

- Strong understanding of React hooks and state management
- Lifting state and passing data between components
- Controlled inputs and form validation
- Conditional rendering based on user actions
- Reusable and modular component design
- Translating real world problems into working software logic

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User adds or selects a friend from the list
2. Total bill amount is entered
3. User and friend expenses are calculated
4. User selects who paid the bill
5. User clicks **Split bill**
6. Application instantly updates balances using React state

Positive balance means the friend owes the user
Negative balance means the user owes the friend

## ▶️ Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app runs locally at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📂 Project Structure

- `App.js` – Centralized application logic and state management
- Reusable components for friends list, bill form, and UI controls
- Clear separation of concerns for maintainable code

## 🎯 Purpose

I built this project to strengthen my React fundamentals and showcase my ability to take an idea from concept to a fully working application. It highlights my readiness for junior frontend or full stack roles that require clean, maintainable, and interactive UI development.
