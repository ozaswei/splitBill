    <title>Split Bill App – Built by Ozaswei Bahadur Tamrakar</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>💸 Eat and Split </h1>

    <p>
        This is a fully functional React application that I designed and built from scratch to
        solve a common real world problem: splitting expenses with friends and tracking balances
        accurately. The app demonstrates my ability to build interactive user interfaces, manage
        application state, and implement clean business logic using modern React practices.
    </p>

    <h2>🚀 Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented a dynamic friend management system</li>
        <li>Built a bill splitting workflow with real time balance calculations</li>
        <li>Implemented controlled forms with validation and clean UX</li>
        <li>Developed reusable, modular React components</li>
        <li>Used conditional rendering to guide user interactions</li>
        <li>Maintained state consistency across multiple components</li>
        <li>Created a clean and intuitive UI for everyday use</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛠️ Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>React (Hooks, useState)</li>
        <li>JavaScript ES6+</li>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS3</li>
        <li>Component based architecture</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📈 What This Project Demonstrates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Strong understanding of React fundamentals and hooks</li>
        <li>State management and data flow between components</li>
        <li>Form handling and user input validation</li>
        <li>Problem solving with real world business logic</li>
        <li>Clean, readable, and maintainable code structure</li>
        <li>Ability to take a project from idea to working product</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧠 How the App Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>User selects or adds a friend</li>
        <li>Total bill amount is entered</li>
        <li>User expense and friend expense are calculated</li>
        <li>User selects who paid the bill</li>
        <li>The app instantly updates balances using React state</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <strong>Positive balance</strong> indicates the friend owes the user<br>
        <strong>Negative balance</strong> indicates the user owes the friend
    </p>

    <h2>▶️ Running the App Locally</h2>
    <pre>

npm install
npm start

</pre>

    <p>The app runs locally at <code>http://localhost:3000</code></p>

    <h2>📂 Code Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>App.js</code> – Centralized application logic and state management</li>
        <li>Custom components for friends list, bill form, and UI controls</li>
        <li>Clear separation of concerns for maintainability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎯 Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>
        I built this application to strengthen my React skills and demonstrate my ability to
        translate real world problems into clean, functional software. This project highlights
        my readiness to work on production level front end applications and collaborate on
        modern JavaScript codebases.
